### Task: Sort students array

Hello, mate! This task is not hard, we know about your skills, we know you can sort anything.
This task to train your brain and practice your skill for write types, enums, and use them in TypeScript projects.

What about your task?
It's simple: Implement function `sortStudents`, which takes array of students, string which represent type of sort, and sort order (asc, desc)

Your task is:
1) Describe Student type, there is an example of student object:
```
{
  name: 'Jessica',
  surname: 'Buxton',
  age: 26,
  married: true,
  grades: [5, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4],
}
```

2) Create SortField enum. Possible fields from tests (you can provide extra fields if you need it):
```
  Name
  Surname
  Age
  Married
  AverageGrade
```

3) Create literal type SortOrder. Possible orders: 'asc' and 'desc'.
